This package contains code used to calibrate the Mars WRF GCM's ice model. The ice model uses five (or more) parameters need to be calibrated to the available surface pressure observations from the Viking Landers. The code contained in *simulations* is used to produce an ensemble of model runs and the correctly simulate observations of the surface pressure at the Viking Lander sites. The *python* directory contains Python/scipy code to fit the pressure curves to harmonic functions and produce an updated state vector of the parameters used in the ice model.
